# Computer Networks Lab Assignment – 5th Semester

This repo contains the code for our Computer Networks lab assignment for the 5th semester.

## Task Description
We were tasked with writing a socket program to implement a TCP client and server such that:

- In a multi-client setup, there are **4 systems**, and each system should have **4 clients**.
- All clients can send data to the server.
- The server can send a message to any selected client.
- The user should be able to set a **timer** for deleting the message either after **2 minutes** or manually from the server.

## Implementation
The implementation has been done in **Python**, using socket programming to handle the multi-client communication and message-handling logic.
